        "A **benchmark** is a trusted, labeled dataset used as a ground truth reference to evaluate model performance.  \n",
        "Think of it as your *reality check* — it lets you see how well a model really understands your domain and tasks.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Benchmarks are the backbone of **model evaluation and continuous improvement**. Without them, it’s hard to know if a new model or prompt version actually performs better — or just seems to.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A good benchmark lets you:\n",
        "- 🔁 Compare models from different providers on the *same data*  \n",
        "- 🧩 Identify strengths and weaknesses across labels or categories  \n",
        "- 📈 Track progress over time as your models evolve  \n",
        "- ✅ Build trust in your model’s predictions through measurable accuracy  \n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, benchmarks turn subjective “it looks better” claims into **objective evidence**.  \n",
